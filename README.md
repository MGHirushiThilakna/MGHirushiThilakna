# Hi there 👋 
## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm **Hirushi Thilakna**, a **Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) graduate from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka**, with a strong passion for **data analysis**, **data visualization**, and **problem-solving** through technology.

I have hands-on experience working with:
- 📊 **Power BI** and **Excel** for building dynamic dashboards  
- 🐍 **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib) for data cleaning and analysis  
- 🗃️ **SQL/MySQL** for querying and managing databases  
- 🌐 Web technologies like **PHP**, **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**

I enjoy turning raw data into meaningful insights that support better decision-making.  
I've completed several academic and self-driven projects related to **data analysis** and **web development**, all available here on my GitHub.

Currently, I'm seeking **internship or entry-level opportunities** to apply my skills in a real-world setting and grow as a professional data analyst.
